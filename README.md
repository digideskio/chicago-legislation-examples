## Resolutions
We're currently drafting example XML documents for Chicago resolutions.  The drafts are based on the USLM markup defined by the US House of Representatives, and the USLM User Guide is included in this repository.

Example documents from the federal level can be found at [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/BILLS](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/BILLS) including extra resources [on the resources page of that link](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/BILLS/resources).

The PDF versions can be found in the `resolutions/pdf` directory and their xml representations are in the `resolutions/xml` directory, matching based on name.  

ie. `resolutions/pdf/R2015-232.pdf` -> `resolutions/xml/R2015-232.xml`
